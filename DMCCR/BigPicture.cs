        //dont know what exactly to do here. could maybe have another thing
        //woudl be cool if i found a way to make this a list of controls for the thing like a second window and when i press a + button the image gets better or something




        //idea. maybe create a bitmap out of th eimage you already have that way it can maybe have a grid and be easier to edit?
